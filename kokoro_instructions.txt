- create a new virtual environment inside /chatbot_backend, call it kokoro_env

- install the kokoro-onnx library: https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/tree/main
- install soundfile


- Download these two files:
    kokoro-v1.0.onnx https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files-v1.0/kokoro-v1.0.onnx
    voices-v1.0.bin  https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files-v1.0/voices-v1.0.bin

- place these two files (kokoro-v1.0.onnx, voices-v1.0.bin) in chatbot_backend/audio/

- in .env file, add the absolute path to the folder "kokoro_env"
it should look something like this "C:\..\..\..\sage\chatbot-backend\kokoro_env" 

- try running the app as usual, there may be other packages that you need to install in the new virtual 
environment, will add a kokoro_requirements.txt soon
